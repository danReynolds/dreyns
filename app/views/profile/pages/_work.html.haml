      I am currently a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I recently finished a 4-month co-op term with the Waterloo based travel company Demeure, as a Ruby on Rails developer.

        I have experience working with teams in an agile environment, managing tasks using tools like Sprint.ly and Github. Prior to co-op and my recent academic terms, I spent the previous summer as a research student at York University, working with a group on the Athenian's Project, an ongoing effort to analyze the data collected on the people of Ancient Greece.
